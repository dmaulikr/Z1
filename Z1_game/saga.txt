Vast is space… complete is the destruction… 
n my womb you rejuvenate… fragmented visions
of past horrors, endless suffering and the
chaos of humanity’s great retreat stirs your
soul. Reborn for my love. Reborn for my
vainness. Reborn for my vengeance. Too soon
we must shift to real space to anew our witness
of this dread Krek plague. Cruel are their
unrelenting swarms. Shorn with mercy. Yet as I
enumerate their patterns I am consumed by the
revelation of their miscalculation. The way is
clear. Rebirth is near. All shall fear.

These are only the beginning chapters of the
