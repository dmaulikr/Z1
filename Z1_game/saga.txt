My dearest Camilla. The night you died I dreamed a thousand new paths. In my dream you
were still alive. We were wandered the streets of New Shanghai hand in hand. Always the
philosopher, you asked, 'Does everything end in emptiness before death?' And now, twenty
years later, I am still haunted by your question. Perhaps all men are so? We reach and
reach, finding new worlds, building new civilizations, creating new dynasties and fighting
our wars. Never finding the answer or other sentient life. Some say we are truly alone and
godless. Others say the End Times is upon us. Science has driven me to my chosen path. But
what will the Z1 project mean to humankind with the ability to travel distance stars in a
blink of an eye? Will it offer enlightenment and bring us closer to god? Or will it lead
us to a path of extinction? I fear for my success. I fear for our daughter Lea. She is so
much like you. And the boy Artur, now a man, so far removed from the day I found him in
the slums of Old Kiev. Always nearby as a brother and like the father I never was. Perhaps
I grow sentimental in my old age? Perhaps it is time to make way for the younger
generation such as my assistant Asha. She reminds me of my younger days when I met you. So
full of ambition that one. Ah to retire to New Shanghai and enjoy a simple game of
mahjong. Perhaps when this project concludes it will be time to walk a new path. Away from
this remote system on the edge of human space. - Dr. Albert Hwan.
